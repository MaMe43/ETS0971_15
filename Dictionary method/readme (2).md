# dict.clear()
The `dict.clear()` method removes all elements from a dictionary, leaving it empty. It operates in place, does not accept any arguments, and does not return a value. After execution, the dictionary's length becomes 0. This method is useful when you want to reuse an existing dictionary but need to clear its contents first.

# dict.copy()
The `dict.copy()` method creates a shallow copy of a dictionary. It does not take any arguments and returns a new dictionary containing the same key-value pairs as the original. Modifications to the new dictionary do not affect the original, and vice versa. This method is helpful when you need a duplicate of a dictionary while preserving the original.

# dict.fromkeys(seq, value=None)
The `dict.fromkeys()` method generates a new dictionary with keys from the provided sequence (`seq`) and assigns them a specified value. If no value is given, the default is `None`. This method is useful for initializing dictionaries with predefined keys and a common default value.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.fromkeys(seq, value=None)`  

**Parameters:**  
- `seq`: A sequence of elements to be used as dictionary keys.  
- `value` (optional): The value assigned to each key. Defaults to `None`.

# dict.get()
The `dict.get()` method retrieves the value associated with a specified key in a dictionary. It accepts two arguments: the key to search for and an optional default value to return if the key is not found. If the key exists, its value is returned; otherwise, the default value is returned. This method is useful for safely accessing dictionary values without raising a `KeyError`.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.get(key, default=None)`  

**Parameters:**  
- `key`: The key to look up in the dictionary.  
- `default` (optional): The value to return if the key is not found. Defaults to `None`.

# dict.items()
The `dict.items()` method returns a view object displaying the dictionary's key-value pairs as tuples. This view reflects any changes made to the dictionary. It does not take any arguments and is useful for iterating over a dictionary or converting it into a list of tuples.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.items()`

# dict.keys()
The `dict.keys()` method returns a view object displaying all the keys in a dictionary. This view reflects any changes made to the dictionary. It does not take any arguments and is useful for accessing or iterating over dictionary keys. The view can also be converted into a list if needed.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.keys()`

# dict.pop()
The `dict.pop()` method removes a specified key from a dictionary and returns its value. It accepts two arguments: the key to remove and an optional default value to return if the key is not found. If the key exists, it is removed, and its value is returned. If the key does not exist and no default value is provided, a `KeyError` is raised. This method is useful for retrieving and removing an item in one step.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.pop(key, default=None)`  

**Parameters:**  
- `key`: The key to remove from the dictionary.  
- `default` (optional): The value to return if the key is not found. Defaults to `None`.

# dict.popitem()
The `dict.popitem()` method removes and returns the last key-value pair from a dictionary as a tuple. It does not take any arguments and modifies the dictionary in place. If the dictionary is empty, a `KeyError` is raised. This method is useful for processing items in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.popitem()`  

**Returns:**  
A tuple containing the last key-value pair from the dictionary.

# dict.setdefault()
The `dict.setdefault()` method retrieves the value of a specified key. If the key does not exist, it inserts the key with a specified default value and returns that value. This method ensures that a key exists in a dictionary with a default value if it is not already present.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.setdefault(key, default=None)`  

**Parameters:**  
- `key`: The key to look up in the dictionary.  
- `default` (optional): The value to insert and return if the key is not found. Defaults to `None`.

**Returns:**  
The value associated with the key if it exists, or the default value if the key is not found.

# dict.update()
The `dict.update()` method updates a dictionary with key-value pairs from another dictionary or an iterable of key-value pairs. If a key already exists, its value is updated; otherwise, the key-value pair is added. This method modifies the dictionary in place and does not return a value.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.update([other])`  

**Parameters:**  
- `other` (optional): A dictionary or an iterable of key-value pairs (e.g., a list of tuples) to update the dictionary with.

**Returns:**  
None.

This method is useful for merging dictionaries or adding multiple key-value pairs in one operation.

# dict.values()
The `dict.values()` method returns a view object displaying all the values in a dictionary. This view reflects any changes made to the dictionary. It does not take any arguments and is useful for accessing or iterating over dictionary values. The view can also be converted into a list if needed.

**Syntax:**  
`dict.values()`  

**Returns:**  
A view object containing all the values in the dictionary.
